## **Assignment 6**
### **Gavin Farrell 16367571**


### **0. Pre set-up**
-Sorted issues from other day by sorting out my filesystem out <br/>
-Got the fastqc and trimmomatic software to work <br/>
-Below are the files used as inputs and their outputs from both softwares utilised via python and the .py scripts

### **1. Files and directory set up as detailed**
-thesis/fastqc_files.py <br/>
-thesis/trimmomatic_script.py <br/>
-thesis/README.txt <br/>
-thesis/test_dataset <br/>
-thesis/fastqc_out <br/>
-thesis/trim_out <br/>

-Each file named above stored in a directory locally called 'thesis'

### **2. Ensure github installed and configured to user as in practical**
-already done, but would use apt-get install git and then config user and email commands in command line to set it up from fresh <br/>
-git website: https://github.com/gavinf97

### **3. At command line**
Initialise git when in the thesis directory <br/>
'>git init

### **4. Github iniated so now can add to local git repository** 
'>git add ('file_name' **or** use '*' to add all)

### **5. Github commit the additions and annotate the commit** 
'>git commit -m Python makes me sad

### **6. All files committed to local git repository with annotation message**
Check if they actually did commit with git log function

### **7.Git log check** 
'>git log

**OUTPUT:** <br/>

'> nano README.txt <br>
-change some text with nano

'>git diff <br>
-New output due to differences made to README.txt file <br>

**OUTPUT:** <br/>
#This README file is an explanation of each file
 #fastqc_script.py
+This is a python script that will run fastqc on input data
 
 #trimmomatic.py
+This is a python script that will run trimmomatic trimming software QC input data
 
 #test_data
+The input data for the programmes to run on
 
 #fastqc_out
+Our data outputs from the fastqc python script on the test_data
 
 #trim_out

Push our 6 files in thesis to the thesis repository <br/>
'>git push -u origin main

**OUTPUT:** <br/>

### **11. Check the thesis github repository with all of the files**
https://github.com/gavinf97/thesis
    
### **12. Wrap up the assingment by  adding this beautiful .Rm file to the github folder**
Put the ass6_16367571.md in thesis directory <br>

Add and commit the .md <br>
'>git add ass_16367571.md <br>
'>git commit ass_16367571.md -m Add in md file of assignmnet 6 <br>
'>git push -u origin main<br>

(for once everything wasnt crashing and burning, anyways happy Christmas and thanks for the module. I learned a lot and maybe cried a little along the way)
